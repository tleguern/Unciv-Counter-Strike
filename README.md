## Current state

- [X] Civilisations: Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists
- [X] Spawn point as a non movable Settler
- [X] Five starting Warriors
- [X] Crashes Unciv

## Ideas

- [ ] Capturable Hostages
- [ ] Dedicated maps (dust2, ...)
- [ ] Specialized units: sniper, shotgun, ...
- [ ] Predefined spawn sites with startBias
